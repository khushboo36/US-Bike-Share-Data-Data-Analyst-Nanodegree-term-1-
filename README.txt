ABOUT PROJECT:

In this project, we have written Python code to import US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
We  have made a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

SOFTWARES USED:

To complete this project, the following software were used:
-Python 3 and Pandas installed using Anaconda
-A text editor i.e Atom.
-Anaconda prompt to run scripts

LIBRARY USED:

To complete this project, the following libraries were used:
-Import csv 
-Import time
 
-From datetime import datetime  

-Import calendar


COMPUTED STATS:
In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time):
-most common month
-most common day of week
-most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip:
-most common start station
-most common end station
-most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration:
-total travel time
-average travel time

#4 User info:
-counts of each user type
-counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)

#5 Birth year info:
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)


ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS:

-The city file name can be in Upper as well as in LowerCase.
-Specified filter of timeperiod can be in Upper as well as in LowerCase.
-To make it user friendly different prompts have been used.
-'Choice to exit' by pressing '-1' facility is given at every stage.
-The computation time has been considered and during that time appropriate message is displayed.
-The code is error free and error handling is properly done.
-User entering wrong input will get a proper message.
-Choice to display raw data is given.
